Given their involuntary nature, we tend to give little thought to how they really work.</p>\n<p>Comprehension is one such process: we’ve applied it unconsciously since the early stages of our lives, experiencing the satisfying feeling of when something clicks, as well as the confusion of when “we don’t get it”. Our natural inclination is to associate these outcomes to our level of intelligence, without really considering what truly determined “comprehension” and what its inner mechanisms are.</p>\n<h2>Categorization</h2>\n<p>Reality is complex and made of many particles, structures and details. If we were to explicitly declare each property and attribute of every instance of reality, we wouldn’t be able to describe anything. For that reason we group instances based on some underlying feature or quality. Some people in the field of mental cognition call this process <strong>categorization</strong>.</p>\n<p>Categorization is a fancier term for <strong>pattern recognition</strong> and it’s inductive by nature. At some point when we were kids, we saw for the first time a dog and we learned to associate the word “dog” (amongst other things) to that specific creature. As we grew older, we got to see and interact with many more instances of dogs, subconsciously updating our internal understanding of what a dog is, until it was sophisticated enough that it didn’t need further refinements.</p>\n<p>As we got into school, the inductive nature of this process got slowly replaced by a more deductive “explanatory” approach, where we try to infer the meaning from a definition instead of from a set of use cases. Giving a formal definition of a concept does not equate to and is not required for comprehension. A six years old may not be able to define “what is a number”, but they can perform basic additions and subtractions, which in my opinion is far more useful.</p>\n<h2>The only way</h2>\n<p>My thesis is that the inductive way, is the <em>only</em> way to “true” **comprehension. If we model this process as a function, its inputs would be “a set of instances of reality”, and the output “a useful mental model that allows us to reason and interact with such instances”.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Set&lt;instances> → Mental Model</code></p>\n<p>If you don’t provide inputs, the function will not compute: that’s why it’s so hard to explain what a color is to a blind person, or imagine what a 4th dimensional object may look like. We have a workaround, namely <strong>analogies</strong> (colors are <em>like</em> sounds for the eyes) which unfortunately don’t give us nearly the same level of understanding as by having access to the real things.</p>\n<h2>Epilogue</h2>\n<p>Through these observations I realized that most of the concepts I found inaccessible, were actually me lacking context and not identifying the underlying instances behind what that concept was trying to model.</p>\n<p>Once you identify the instances and play around with them, comprehension just happens, just like falling asleep when you close your eyes after a hard day of work.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Inductive learning","date":"10 Dec 2022","description":null}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"519d69df-471c-5a27-819a-84b262240066","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
