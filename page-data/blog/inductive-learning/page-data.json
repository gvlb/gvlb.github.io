What do they look like? What do they do? What use do they have?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>When there are no concrete instances of a concept, the next best thing is to create associations with abstraction you do understand.\ne.g. we generalize the concept of dimensions to make sense of the 4th or higher dimensions.</p>\n<p>Note that this doesn’t give us real “understanding” of the 4th dimension, but it lets us reason and make computations with it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>(write something)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>to add maybe:\n<strong>Association</strong>\nAnother way to help us make sense of non-trivial abstractions is by associating them with concepts we’re already familiar with.</p>\n<p>the more accurate your mental representation is, the easier you understand and make sense of things</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Inductive learning","date":"04-07-2022","description":"how to understand concepts"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"building-concept"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building concept"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"519d69df-471c-5a27-819a-84b262240066","previousPostId":"1157b54e-41ee-5df2-9789-95e988d6ceda","nextPostId":null}},
