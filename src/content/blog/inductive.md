title: Inductive learning
description: how to understand concepts
---

The term inductive learning comes from inductive reasoning.
It identifies the process of drawing conclusions by performing a body of observations.

### Instances and abstractions
We use abstractions to describe concepts and communicate with each other.
Each abstraction contains a set of instances, the things they're abstracting from.<br />
*e.g. 'the American Bulldog I saw yesterday' is a single instance of 'dog'*

Abstractions are created by extracting the common features, behaviors and uses from their instances.<br />
*e.g. Dogs have four legs, a good sense of smell, bark and are man's best friend*

### Understanding abstractions
The common way concepts (abstractions) are taught in schools is by giving a definition.
Usually definitions make sense when you already understand the concept:<br />
*e.g. logarithm := the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given number*
	
Humans infer abstractions inductively, by identifying and interacting with concrete instances.<br />
*e.g. kid sees, touches, plays with a lot of dogs -> kid knows what a dog is*

The more ways you can visualize, manipulate, apply a concept, the better you understand it.
(that's kind of the definition of "understanding", isn't it)

### In practice
I've found that among all of the concepts I've had trouble to fully grasp, I didn't work on identifying their instances and manipulating their properties.

**Tip:** when not understanding a concept, ask the following:
What are its instances? What do they look like? What do they do? What use do they have?

When there are no concrete instances of a concept, the next best thing is to create associations with abstraction you do understand.
e.g. we generalize the concept of dimensions to make sense of the 4th or higher dimensions.

Note that this doesn't give us real "understanding" of the 4th dimension, but it lets us reason and make computations with it.

## Conclusion
(write something)

to add maybe:
**Association**
Another way to help us make sense of non-trivial abstractions is by associating them with concepts we're already familiar with.

the more accurate your mental representation is, the easier you understand and make sense of things
