# Definition
To build - can have many different meanings (a relationship, a boat, a physique).

Here I'm defining it as "producing something that will be experienced by someone (or something) else".

# Partially known system
When you don't have a full idea of what or how you're building something:
- start small, expand later.
This principle is also used in [[problem solving]].

# Iterative building
Some people have perfected and mastered the process of drawing a realistic portrait. (see speed drawing on youtube)

If we apply those principles to any kind of building we conclude that building should be:
- top-down - make sure you're doing end-to-end, akin to [[learning_framework|learning]].
- iterative

# Building for humans
When the recipient is [[human values|human]], focus on reducing their [[cognitive load]].

# Clean up periodically
Some systems have a potentially infinite building process (e.g. software, political system, mental ideas).

In such cases, **overhead** will happen.
To reduce such complexity it's important to "refactor" your system periodically.
